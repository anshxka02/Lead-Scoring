## Lead Scoring Case Study

In this case study, we will explore a lead scoring problem where we are given a dataset containing information about leads, and we need to build a model that can predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer. 

The dataset contains the following features:

- Lead Source
- Total Visits
- Total Time Spent on Website
- Page Views Per Visit
- Last Activity
- Country
- Specialization
- What is your current occupation
- How did you hear about X Education
- Tags
- Lead Quality
- Lead Profile
- City
- Asymmetrique Activity Score
- Asymmetrique Profile Score
- I agree to pay the amount through cheque
- A free copy of Mastering The Interview
- Last Notable Activity
- Converted (Target Variable)

We will follow these steps to build the lead scoring model:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building and Evaluation

The EDA will involve exploring the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns. We will then preprocess the data by cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming features as necessary. Next, we will perform feature engineering to create new features that may improve the model's performance. Finally, we will build a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
